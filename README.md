# Water-Resources-problem
Water scarcity modeling (2030)

## Description
Fresh water is an important resource globally with several factors impacting fresh water reserves. Our startup company *Chronus Water Health Inc.* has been contracted by the US Federal government to advice and help them build a strategy road map. As the only data scientist/engineer on the team your role is critical in this project. 

Build a mathematical model for determining an effective, feasible, and cost-efficient water strategy meet the projected water needs in United States for 2030, and identify the best water strategy. 

In particular, your mathematical model must address:
* storage and movement; 
* de-salinization; and 
* conservation. 

Your model will be used to discuss the economic, physical, and environmental implications of your strategy. Provide a non-technical summary outlining your approach, its feasibility and costs and why it is the “best water strategy choice.”


## Submission
* Language: Python
* Use public databases, do not assume data. Assumptions need to explained and have strong reasoning based on data and your models.
* Upload the code, results summary and your analysis to your private github respository 
* Share the link by email once completed.
* Image of a possible complete model (i.e the variables you did not include) - take a screenshot or photo and send it with your submission

## Expectations
* Do no spend more than a total of 3-6 hours on this problem
* We do not expect a complete solution - this is a code screening
* Expectations is to use atleast 2 public databases to develop a simple model
* Write out the variables that you would want to incorporate in a model
* We plan to discuss this after you send it out

## Timeline
* 1 hour decide on variables and models
* 1 hour to find databases
* 1- 3 hours hours to code
### Total time < 3 - 6 hours

## Example Datasets
* US population: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popproj/data/datasets.All.html
* Estimated use of water in the United states in 2010 https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1405/pdf/circ1405.pdf


## Disclaimer 
*We have not been contracted by the Federal government for any work nor are we a water consulting company advising any government entity on any strategy. This is a hypothetical scenario for screening job applicants applying to Chronus Health*

* did you read this 1: send an email to schedule an initial discussion before you start solving and coding
* did you read this 2: Simplify, Simplify, Simplify
* did you read this 3: Whoa !! did you just say -I dont have time for this !!  or did you think what are we trying to get you to do here. Well, we are evaluating your analytical and coding capabilities thats needed for this position - its that simple - so simplify the problem as much as you can. We don't need a complete solution.  If you could solve or predict the water scarcity issues in a coding interview for the entire continental United States - we may give you medal or even reach out to our hypothetical Federal government contact to give you a medal.
* Simplify by treating US as one homogenous unit without taking variation by county and state into account OR just model data for one specific state or county.
* did you read this 5: In hindsight, we are also looking if have attention to details to see if you read all the way to the end.
