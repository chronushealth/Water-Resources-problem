# Water-Resources-problem
Water scarcity modeling (2030)

## Description
Fresh water is an important resource globally with several factors impacting fresh water reserves. Our startup company *Chronus Water Health Inc.* has been contracted by the US Federal government to advice and help them build a strategy road map. As the only data scientist/engineer on the team your role is critical in this project. 

Build a mathematical model for determining an effective, feasible, and cost-efficient water strategy meet the projected water needs of United States in 2030, and identify the best water strategy. 

In particular, your mathematical model must address:
* storage and movement; 
* de-salinization; and 
* conservation. 

Your model will be used to discuss the economic, physical, and environmental implications of your strategy. Provide a non-technical summary outlining your approach, its feasibility and costs and why it is the “best water strategy choice.”


## Submission
* Language: Python
* Use public databases, do not assume data. Assumptions need to explained and have strong reasoning based on data and your models.
* Upload the code, results summary and your analysis to your private github respository 
* Share the link by email once completed.

## Disclaimer 
*We have not been contracted by the Federal government for any work nor are we a water consulting company advising any government entity on any strategy. This is a hyothetical scenario for screen job applicants applying to Chronus Health*
